# Unit 1.1 â€“ boolean logic

### Boolean identities

_commutative laws_
(x AND y) = (y AND x)
(x OR y) = (y OR x)

_associative laws_
(x AND (y AND z)) = ((x AND y) AND z)
(x OR (y OR z)) = ((x OR y) OR z)

_distributive laws_
(x AND (y OR z)) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
(x OR (y AND z)) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)

_de Morgan laws_
NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)
NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
